# Weather Challenge Azada Henze

This is the submission of Azada Henze to the Weather-challenge as a part of the application process at exccelent. 
The language for the program was Java, to display abilities of the applicant with no extensive background in Java to display her skills in using knowledge of other languages to apply for problems in new languages.
Due to the scope and the time limit of the project, I prioritized the correctness of the program(program outputs correct answers), readability of the code (comments, variable names) and finally, usability and maintainability 
(OOP). The tests are not extensive but cover basic concepts of the program correctness.
